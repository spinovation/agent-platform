## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Git**: Version control system
- **Node.js**: Version 18 or higher

- **Terraform**: Version 1.5 or higher
- **Docker**: For containerization and local development
- **AWS CLI**: For infrastructure management

### Development Environment Setup

1. **Fork and clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/agent-platform.git
   cd agent-platform
   ```

2. **Set up the development environment:**
   ```bash
   # Install backend dependencies
   cd backend && npm install

   # Install frontend dependencies
   cd ../frontend && npm install

   # Install agent framework dependencies
   cd ../agents && pip install -r requirements.txt -r requirements-dev.txt

   # Return to project root
   cd ..
   ```

3. **Configure pre-commit hooks:**
   ```bash
   pip install pre-commit
   pre-commit install
   ```

## üìã Development Workflow

### Branch Strategy

We use a Git flow branching strategy:

- **`main`**: Production-ready code
- **`develop`**: Integration branch for features
- **`feature/*`**: Feature development branches
- **`hotfix/*`**: Critical bug fixes
- **`release/*`**: Release preparation branches

### Creating a Feature Branch

```bash
# Start from develop branch
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop

# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

# Make your changes and commit
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add your feature description"

# Push to your fork
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

### Commit Message Convention

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

**Types:**
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

**Examples:**
```
feat(agents): add email processing agent
fix(auth): resolve token validation issue
docs(api): update authentication endpoints
test(backend): add unit tests for user service
```

## üß™ Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm run test:all

# Run infrastructure tests
cd infrastructure && terraform plan

# Run backend tests
cd backend && npm test

# Run frontend tests
cd frontend && npm test

# Run agent tests
cd agents && pytest
```

### Test Coverage

Maintain test coverage above 80% for all components:

- **Backend**: Unit tests, integration tests, API tests
- **Frontend**: Component tests, integration tests, E2E tests
- **Agents**: Unit tests, integration tests, behavior tests
- **Infrastructure**: Terraform validation, security scans
